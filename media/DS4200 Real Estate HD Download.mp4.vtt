Hi, and welcome to our demo video
for real estate in Martha's vineyard.

2
00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:07.640
This is the landing page for our
visualization, including information about

3
00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:09.900
our project, as well as
links at the bottom.

4
00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:12.480
In order to actually view our
visualization, all you need to do is go

5
00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:17.100
to the top left here and click
the button that says View Visualization.

6
00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.920
Once you click that,

7
00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:21.040
you'll be presented with a map of Martha's
Vineyard that has all of these pins,

8
00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:25.020
which each represent a different
property on Martha's vineyard.

9
00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.080
So if you're interested in a property,

10
00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:30.100
all you need to do is click the pin
representing that property.

11
00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:31.880
And on the right hand side,

12
00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:34.760
you will immediately be presented
with all this data about the property.

13
00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:36.300
So you can see what it looks like,

14
00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:40.180
you can see a radius score of how this
property scores on different metrics,

15
00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:43.840
the address,
and for all of the numerical attributes we

16
00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:48.820
have listed on this radius score,
we have additional visualizations.

17
00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:50.640
So, we can see here with price,

18
00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.280
we have a price gauge and we can see where
this property sits with regards to all

19
00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:57.500
of the other properties
we have in this data set.

20
00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:59.960
This property is about $1.2 million,

21
00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:05.620
which is on the lower end of properties
in terms of price that we have here.

22
00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:07.980
We also have all of these bubble charts

23
00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.240
that show all the different
towns of Martha's vineyard.

24
00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:14.490
You can see here where the property
you're looking at sits.

25
00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:15.680
Find this red dot over here.

26
00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:20.050
You can see where the property that you're
looking at sits with regards to

27
00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:25.210
the town that it sits in, as well as all
the other towns in Martha's vineyard.

28
00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:32.700
We have this for price, bedrooms,
bathrooms, square footage, lot size,

29
00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:35.880
and at the bottom,
we have information about the real estate

30
00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:39.850
agent or the listing agent that is
in charge of working with this property.

31
00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:42.640
So if you're a potential buyer,
you're interested in continuously pursuing

32
00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:46.780
this property as a possible purchase,
this is who you would contact,

33
00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:50.180
and this would be the point at which
the visualization has done its job.

34
00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:50.720
Thank you very much.
